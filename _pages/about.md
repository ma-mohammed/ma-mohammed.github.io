I am a PhD student in Civil Engineering with a focus on Transportation Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I also completed my MS in Civil Engineering and MS in Computer Science. My research bridges transportation systems and data science, with particular expertise in origin-destination modeling, passenger typology analysis, and transportation safety.

My current research focuses on developing novel computational frameworks for understanding transit passenger behavior using mobile ticketing data. I have created innovative trip chaining models that integrate passenger typology and seasonal variations to infer complete journey patterns in regional transit systems. Through machine learning techniques including gradient boosting and dynamic time warping, I have achieved significant improvements in prediction accuracy for transit demand estimation.

In addition to my transit research, I work on transportation safety analysis using spatial clustering and machine learning to identify crash typologies across census tracts. I am also investigating cyclist behavior and developing schematic bicycle maps to enhance cycling accessibility and adoption.

I have published my research in leading transportation journals including the *International Journal of Transportation Science and Technology* and *Data Science for Transportation*. My work has been presented at major conferences including the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting and INFORMS conferences.

Before beginning my graduate studies, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering with First Class Honors from the University of Khartoum in Sudan, where I also worked as a teaching assistant and conducted research on elevated light rail systems for developing cities.
