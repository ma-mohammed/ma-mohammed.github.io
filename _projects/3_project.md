## Project Overview

This undergraduate research project developed a feasibility study for implementing a caterpillar-style elevated light rail system to alleviate traffic congestion in developing cities, using Khartoum, Sudan, as a case study.

## Research Objectives

- Evaluate the feasibility of elevated light rail systems for developing urban areas
- Conduct route optimization analysis using GIS technology
- Assess financial and environmental impacts of the proposed system
- Estimate potential reductions in COâ‚‚ emissions and travel delays

## Methodology

**Route Optimization**
- Used GIS analysis to identify the most efficient corridors for deployment
- Considered existing urban fabric and infrastructure constraints
- Analyzed traffic flow patterns and population density

**Impact Assessment**  
- Evaluated financial implications and cost-benefit analysis
- Estimated environmental benefits including emissions reduction
- Assessed potential improvements in urban mobility and accessibility

## Key Results

- Developed comprehensive route network design for Khartoum metropolitan area
- Demonstrated significant potential for traffic congestion reduction
- Showed promising environmental benefits through reduced vehicle emissions
- Provided framework applicable to other developing cities

## Recognition

**Best Project Award** - Received the Best Project Award from the Civil Engineering Department at University of Khartoum for innovative contributions to urban mobility solutions.
