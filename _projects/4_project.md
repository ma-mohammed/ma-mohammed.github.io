## Research Overview

This ongoing research project investigates how schematic bicycle maps can influence cyclist behavior and improve cycling accessibility. The study aims to understand cyclists' map preferences and develop design principles for more effective bicycle navigation tools.

## Project Objectives

- Assess cycling preferences, route choices, and perceptions of existing bicycle infrastructure
- Understand how map design affects cycling behavior and route selection
- Develop improved bicycle map designs that enhance accessibility and adoption
- Investigate potential impacts on greenhouse gas emissions through increased cycling

## Methodology

**Survey Development**
- Created comprehensive survey to assess cycling preferences and infrastructure perceptions
- Incorporated insights from prior research on bicycle navigation and safety concerns
- Designed to capture representative sample of cyclists across different user types

**Data Collection and Analysis**
- Currently in data collection phase
- Focus on understanding cyclist decision-making processes
- Analysis of relationships between map features and usage patterns

## Expected Outcomes

This research is expected to contribute to:
- Better understanding of cyclist map preferences and needs
- Evidence-based design principles for bicycle maps
- Improved cycling infrastructure planning and communication
- Support for sustainable transportation initiatives

## Future Publications

- "Understanding Cyclists' Map Preferences and Needs: Insights from a Survey on Bicycle Map Usage" (planned for late 2025)
- "Schematic Bicycle Maps for Influencing Cyclist Behavior and Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions" (planned for early 2026)

## Collaboration

This research is conducted in collaboration with Prof. Eleni Christofa and Prof. Jimi Oke at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, combining expertise in transportation engineering and behavioral analysis.
