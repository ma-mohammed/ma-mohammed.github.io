This research focuses on developing innovative approaches for understanding passenger travel patterns in public transportation systems using mobile ticketing and automated fare collection data.

## Research Overview

The project addresses the critical challenge of inferring complete origin-destination patterns from partial transit data. Traditional methods rely on expensive smart card systems or extensive surveys, while this research develops cost-effective alternatives using mobile ticketing activations.
