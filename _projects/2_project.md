This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze transportation safety patterns across census tracts in New England states.

## Research Objectives

The goal is to develop a data-driven framework for understanding crash patterns and their relationship to spatial, demographic, and infrastructure characteristics. This work aims to support more targeted and effective transportation safety interventions.

## Methodology

**Data Collection and Processing**
- Collected crash datasets from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Vermont
- Analyzed 2,480 census tracts across the region
- Integrated crash data with demographic and built environment variables

**Dimensionality Reduction**
- Implemented UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to extract latent spatial structures
- Reduced high-dimensional crash feature space while preserving important relationships

**Classification Analysis** 
- Applied Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to classify census tracts into distinct crash typologies
- Generated spatial visualizations showing geographic distribution of crash patterns

## Current Status

The research has completed preliminary validation of the typology framework and is exploring supervised learning models for predictive crash typology analysis using roadway, demographic, and environmental features.
