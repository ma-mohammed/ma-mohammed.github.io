Excited to share that our latest research on enhanced seasonal typology-informed transit trip chaining has been published in *Data Science for Transportation*!

---

This work represents a significant advancement in our understanding of passenger behavior in regional transit systems. The paper introduces a novel trip chaining model that incorporates passenger typology and seasonal variations to infer complete passenger journeys using boarding-only AFC data.

#### Key Contributions

- **Advanced Machine Learning Integration**: Implemented gradient boosting machines (GBM) for spatial error correction
- **Significant Accuracy Improvements**: Achieved 70% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 85% reduction in Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)
- **Practical Validation**: Model validated with comprehensive survey data from Pioneer Valley Transit Authority
- **Scalable Framework**: Designed for adoption by regional transit agencies lacking smart card infrastructure

The research addresses a critical challenge faced by many transit agencies: understanding complete passenger journeys when only boarding data is available. By incorporating passenger typology insights and accounting for seasonal variations, our model provides unprecedented accuracy in trip chain inference.

This publication builds on our previous work on passenger typology analysis and represents a major step toward comprehensive origin-destination modeling for regional transit systems. The methodology has potential applications for transit agencies worldwide seeking to optimize their networks and improve service delivery.

> "The integration of passenger typology with machine learning techniques opens new possibilities for understanding transit behavior patterns and improving system efficiency."

The paper is now available in *Data Science for Transportation* and represents the collaborative efforts of our research team at UMass Amherst. This work continues to inform ongoing research in transportation systems optimization and passenger behavior analysis.
